### [addExtra(launcher)](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/blob/5d071b7ad176acc273ac4a2c5b0f176b48546047/packages/playwright-extra/src/index.ts#L22-L23)

- `launcher` **types.PlaywrightBrowserLauncher** Playwright (or compatible) browser launcher

Augment the provided Playwright browser launcher with plugin functionality.

Using `addExtra` will always create a fresh PuppeteerExtra instance.

Example:

```javascript
import playwright from 'playwright'
import { addExtra } from 'playwright-extra

const chromium = addExtra(playwright.chromium)
chromium.use(plugin)
```

### [defaultExport()](https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra/blob/5d071b7ad176acc273ac4a2c5b0f176b48546047/packages/playwright-extra/src/index.ts#L46-L61)

The **default export** will behave exactly the same as the regular playwright
(just with extra plugin functionality) and can be used as a drop-in replacement.

Behind the scenes it will try to require either `playwright`
or `playwright-core` from the installed dependencies.

Please note that due to imports being cached this will result in a single
PlaywrightExtra instance, even when used in different files. If you need multiple
instances (e.g. different plugins) please use `addExtra`.

Example:

```javascript
// javascript import
const { chromium } = require('playwright-extra')

// typescript/es6 module import
import { chromium } from 'playwright-extra'

// Add plugins
chromium.use(...)
```
